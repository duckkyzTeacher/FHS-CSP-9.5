# 1. Write a function called 'multiply' that multiplies  two numbers.
#    Add a docstring that explains the parameters (both integers) and the return value.
#    Then, write an assert statement to test if the function returns the correct result.

# 2. Write a function called 'divide_numbers' that divides two numbers.
#    Add a try-except block to handle division by zero errors and return an appropriate message.

# 3. Write a function called 'greet_user' that takes a name as a parameter and returns a greeting.
#    Document the function with a docstring, including the expected parameter type and return type.

# 4. Write a function called 'safer_greet_user' that has the same functionality as 'greet_user' but raises
#    a ValueError if the name is not a string. Use try-except to catch the error and print a helpful message.

# 5. Create a function called 'calculate_average' that takes a list of numbers as input.
#    Add error handing to check that the list is not empty before calculating the average.
#    If the list is empty return a message that says "Silly goose! You gave me an empty list!"

# 6. Write a function called 'get_number' that takes a string as input and converts it to an integer.
#    Add exception handling for cases where the conversion might fail.
